```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)

```


```{r}
ggplot(data = starwars, aes(x = birth_year, y = height)) +
  geom_point()
```

Just realized I wasn't supposed to make the graph until now... So I'll edit the df


```{r}
tatooine <- starwars %>% 
  filter(homeworld == "Tatooine")
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = tatooine, aes(x = birth_year, y = height)) +
  geom_point()

```
